# Akson

Welcome to Akson! We're building a modern, open-source platform that empowers developers to quickly prototype, develop, and run agentic AI assistants.

## What is Akson?

Akson is a comprehensive system designed to help developers rapidly create, test, and deploy agentic AI assistants. By combining a powerful API, a modern web interface, and a command-line tool, Akson streamlines the process of building and managing AI-driven agents. Our platform is modular, extensible, and developer-friendly, making it easy to customize assistants for your unique needs and iterate quickly on new ideas.

## Our Projects

### [akson-api](https://github.com/akson-ai/akson-api)
The core backend service that powers Akson. Built with Python, it provides a flexible foundation for creating and managing AI assistants. One of its key features is the ability to add custom AI assistants, allowing you to tailor the platform to your specific needs.

### [akson-web](https://github.com/akson-ai/akson-web)
A modern React-based web interface for Akson that provides an intuitive user experience for interacting with Akson's features through your browser.

### [akson-cli](https://github.com/akson-ai/akson-cli)
A command-line interface tool that helps you manage and interact with your AI assistants directly from your terminal. Perfect for automation and quick access to your assistants.

### [akson-compose](https://github.com/akson-ai/akson-compose)
A Docker Compose configuration that brings together all Akson components into a single, easy-to-deploy package. This project makes it simple to get started with Akson by providing a unified setup for all services.

## Getting Started

To get started with Akson:

1. Follow the setup instructions in the [akson-compose](https://github.com/akson-ai/akson-compose) repository to deploy all Akson components.

2. Write your AI assistant as a Python file and place it in the `assistants` directory of the [akson-api](https://github.com/akson-ai/akson-api) repository.

3. Interact with your assistants through the web interface or the command-line interface.

## Feedback & Suggestions
