# I am building AGI.

## What is AGI?

Here is the Wikipedia definition:
> Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that matches
> or surpasses human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks.

## How do I define AGI?

My definition of AGI is slightly different from Wikipedia's.
Right now, building AGI is too ambitious for one person.
There are different levels of AI, and we aren't near AGI yet.
But AI is advanced enough to assist with tasks and solve problems.
I imagine a product that performs tasks at a human-level intelligence.
The first version would be half-intelligent.
It will be an assistant to help with my tasks.

## Why I am doing this?

ChatGPT, Claud and others are good but they are not AGI yet.
They have limited capabilities and not easily extensible.
Above all, they are commercial products and controlled by their owners.
I want to be in full control of my own AGI.

## What is the purpose of this project?

The purpose of this project is to develop a customizable Python-based framework for building personal assistant agents capable of automating and handling specific cognitive tasks. While initially designed for individual developers, the modular structure aims to gradually accommodate non-developers with minimal technical skills. Tasks like reminders, task management, and basic information retrieval will be included in the initial feature set, leaving out learning-based adaptation for future work.

## What am I really building?

I am building a tool for creating personal assistants.
It's going to be a Python project with agent definitions for core functionality and a web interface.
I am writing this document to share my ideas and get feedback.
This is just a dream, so there are no strings attached.

## Features

- Framework for writing tools, assistants and agents.
- Memory for storing and retrieving information.
- Web interface for interacting with them.
- Voice mode for interacting with them.
- Apps for major platforms like iOS, Android, macOS and Windows.

## Who am I building it for?

First, I am building this for myself to solve my own problems.
I want a personalized assistant or a team of assistants that work together.
I don't expect this assistant to be useful for others because it will be highly customized.
I am a developer who can write and debug Python code.
I also target people like me who want to solve their own problems.
The ultimate goal is to make AGI development accessible to non-developers.

## Roadmap

### For myself

- Provide a framework to build my personal assistant.
- Write separate assistants for different tasks.
- Provide a framework for developers to build their own assistants.

### For developers

- Build their assistants.
- Push their tools/assistants/agents to GitHub.

### For users

- Download this project.
- Download selected agents from the Internet.
- Extend functionality by writing new agents.

## What I need right now?

- Feedback from friends and family.

## What I need in the future?

- Get feedback from online forums.
- Get feedback from Reddit and Hacker News.
- Get feedback from colleagues.

## What do I need to get started?

- Write code for core functionality.
